Exercise 1: ParrotPost
Email Header Analysis

Suspicious IP Address: During analysis of the email, an IP address 109.205.120.0 was identified. This IP should be investigated on VirusTotal to check for any malicious reports or associations.

Reply-To vs From: The email’s header reveals that the Reply-To address is different from the From address. This discrepancy is a red flag, as phishing emails often use a different reply-to address to ensure any responses go to the attacker rather than the apparent sender.

Malicious Attachment Indication: Another header field shows an attached HTML file. For example, the header contains an entry:
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="ParrotPostACTIONREQUIRED.htm"
The presence of an HTML attachment named "ParrotPostACTIONREQUIRED.htm" is suspicious. Phishing emails commonly include HTML attachments that lead to fake login forms or malicious content when opened.

Malicious HTML Attachment Analysis

Upon opening the attached file ParrotPostACTIONREQUIRED.htm, the source code appears obfuscated. Notably, the code includes a usage of JavaScript's atob() function on a large string (e.g., atob(b64)). The function atob() is a built-in JavaScript function that decodes a Base64-encoded string into its original text or binary data. This indicates that the HTML file contains data (likely another script or payload) encoded in Base64 to hide its content.

To analyze the hidden content, the Base64 string from the HTML file was extracted and decoded using a tool like CyberChef. After decoding, we obtained additional code from the attachment. This decoded content was then saved to a text file for further inspection.

CSS Obfuscation

The content retrieved from decoding the HTML attachment was still not immediately readable. It contained what looked like heavily obfuscated CSS code. A CSS obfuscator is a tool or technique that makes CSS code extremely difficult to read and understand by altering its structure and naming. This obfuscation is intended to hinder analysis, as it creates significant challenges for anyone trying to reverse-engineer the code. The presence of obfuscated CSS suggests that the phishing page is trying to hide its styling or possibly encode data within styles, adding another layer of complexity to the analysis.

Phishing Page Behavior Analysis

To understand the behavior of the phishing page (the content of the HTML attachment) and see how it handles user input, the following steps were carried out in a safe environment:

Open the Malicious HTML – Launch the ParrotPostACTIONREQUIRED.htm file in a web browser to view the phishing page.

Inspect Network Activity – Open the browser’s Developer Tools (usually by pressing F12) and switch to the Network tab to monitor HTTP requests.

Submit Fake Credentials – Enter dummy credentials into the phishing login form (since this is a suspected fake login page) and submit them. Observe the network traffic generated by this action.

Examine the Response – In the Developer Tools, check the Response of the network request that was triggered by the form submission. This will show how the server responded after receiving the credentials.

These steps help reveal what the phishing page does when a victim enters their credentials, and where that data is being sent or stored.

Extracting Captured Credentials

The network analysis showed that upon submission, the credentials are sent to the attacker's server and stored in a file. Specifically, the response indicated that the stolen credentials are being saved to a creds.txt on the server. Using the information from the response, we can directly visit the URL http://evilparrot.thm:8080/creds.txt to confirm this. Accessing this path on the attacker’s server will display the contents of the creds.txt file. This file contains the captured login credentials and, in the context of the TryHackMe challenge, likely includes a flag or proof of exploitation.

Exercise 2: Merry Clickmas

Overview
The Merry Clickmas challenge focuses on identifying phishing techniques used in seasonal or holiday-themed emails. Attackers often exploit festive themes to lower user suspicion and increase click-through rates.

Phishing Indicators
- Urgent call-to-action related to a holiday reward
- Suspicious sender address
- Embedded links redirecting to non-legitimate domains
- Social engineering through emotional manipulation

Analysis Summary
In this exercise, the phishing email attempted to trick users into clicking a malicious link disguised as a Christmas-related promotion. The link redirected to a fake page designed to harvest user credentials.

Defensive Measures
- Verify sender email addresses
- Avoid clicking links in unsolicited holiday emails
- Use email filtering and phishing detection tools
- Conduct user awareness training
